DESCRIPTION

  METHODS
    "get_list_of_albums(...)"
            To return list of albums for a given google user id. The function takes a reference to hash as an parameter, that includes the following key-value pairs.

        'userid' => <google user id>(mandatory) -- google userid of the
        person for whom you want the album list.

        'access' => 'private|public'(optional) -- by default, returns the
        list of albums which have public access. You need to have 'private'
        value for this key if you want to list out unlisted (private) albums
        and it requires authentication.

            this method returns a reference to hash whose key is album name and value is number of photos present in that album.

        'access' => 'private|public'(optional) -- by default, it marks the
        album as public access. You need to have 'private' value for this
        key if you want to add album as unlisted (private).

        (private) and it requires authentication.

        'dir' => <path-to-download>(optional) -- location to download the
        photos. if not specified, it will create a new directory in the
        format <userid>_<current-time> and photos get downloaded there.
